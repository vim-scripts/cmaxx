This script was inspired by Borland Delphis code template function.

Templates can be defined in text files. The filename (wihtout extension) is the template name. By entering the template name in the document and pressing the expasion key (predefined to <F6>) the template is expanded.

Templates can also use macros which will be replaced bei either a user defined or a predefined text during template expansion.
